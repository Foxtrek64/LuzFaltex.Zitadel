## Contributing changes

We welcome contributions from everyone, but we only merge changes that improve the product and align with our roadmap. Contributions must also satisfy the published guidelines below.

### Do's and Dont's

Please do:

* follow our [coding style](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/main/docs/coding-guidelines/coding-style.md) (C# code-specific).
* give priority to the current style of the project or file you're changing even if it diverges from the general guidelines.
* include tests when adding new features.
* keep the discussions focused. When a new or related topic comes up it's often better to create a new issue than to side track the discussion.

Please do not:

* surprise us with pull requests. Instead, file an issue and start a discussion so we can agree on a direction before you invest time into implementing a fix or feature.
* commit code that you didn't write. If you find code that you think is a good fit to add to LuzFaltex.Zitadel, file an issue and start a discussion before proceeding.
* submit PRs that alter licensing-related files or headers. If you believe there is a problem with them, file an issue and we can discuss it.
